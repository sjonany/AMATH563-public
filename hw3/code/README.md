#  Homework 3: Dimensionality Reduction, Classification and Clustering on Face Data

We perform a variety of analyses on Yale face dataset.
Please see **core.py** for the main algorithms, **face_clustering.ipynb** for clustering between dark and bright backgrounds, **face_identity.ipynb** for classification of person identities, **gender_classification.ipynb** for classification of genders, and **face_svd.ipynb** for low dimensionality analyses.
