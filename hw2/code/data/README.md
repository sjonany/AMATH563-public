# Resources, and their descriptions.
* `population_data.txt` The population of hare and lynx provided from the problem set, manually typed in. The first row "20,32" corresponds to the hare and lynx population at year 1845. Subsequent rows are the populations at year increments of 2. That is, the second row corresponds to year 1847, third row 1849 and so on.
* `sampled_video.npy` is generated by `BZ_video_sampling.ipynb`, where from the huge `BZ.mat` (not checked in, because too big), we just sample a few time frames, and just a small view window.
