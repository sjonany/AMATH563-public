# Homework 1: Regression-based  Digit  Classification  on  the  MNIST  Dataset
We apply three different regression-based approaches to classify handwritten digits from the  MNIST dataset, and compare their performances. The results show that simple regression-based approaches  are able to achieve over 85% accuracy,hence attesting to the usefulness of simple models.

Please see **HW1.ipynb** for all the analysis and plots, and **util.py** for the supporting code.
