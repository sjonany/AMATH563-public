# Homework 2: Model Discovery on Population and Video Datasets
We apply model discovery techniques such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), time-delay embedding and Sparse Identification of   Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to summarize the dynamics encoded within the provided population and video datasets. We also compare the efficacy of these different approaches with various performance metrics such as KL divergence, AIC and BIC.

Please see **lynx_hare.ipynb** for the population analysis, **BZ_video_analysis.ipynb** for video analysis, **core.py** and **util.py** for the supporting code.
